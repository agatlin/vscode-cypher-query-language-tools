This extension is based on previous code extensions from [Ionut Botizan](https://github.com/ionut-botizan/vscode-cypher-ql) and [Jake Boone](https://github.com/jakeboone02/cypher-query-language). Both of these extensions were based on TextMate language packages for [Atom](http://atom.io) ([language-cypher](https://github.com/tobiashm/language-cypher)) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ([Cypher](https://github.com/kollhof/sublime-cypher)).
